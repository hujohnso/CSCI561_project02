CSCI-561 Project 2
==================

Code
----

Implement CNF conversion and DPLL using the starter code in
project-2.lisp.  The grading script will test your implementation by
calling the following functions:

* EXP->CNF
* SAT-P

Significant starter code is provided.  Necessary portions for you to
implement are marked with ;;TODO comments.

Grading will use (approximately) the following procedure:

    sbcl --load project-2.lisp --load project-2-solution.lisp \
         --eval '(run-tests)' --eval '(sb-ext:quit)'

Please ensure that your source file loads cleanly without errors or
side-effects (printing, file output, etc.)
